# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was built in order to provide a webpage that is visually appealing and easy to navigate. It contains notes for Bootcamp students on multiple topics that are clear and thorough, and are all conveniently located in one place. Creating this webpage helped me to learn a little bit about various coding languages (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript) in terms of why and how they are all used by web developers in order to reach a desired outcome.

In here, navigate to the 'Console' tab, and you will be able to see the JavaScript running. Here the topics from prework are listed and you will be able to choose a topic to study first.
